  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I knew how to find where i wanted to programme my website and had already published my first blog having chosen my background a week earlier. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Essentially to choose a colour that i could center on the page and leave my text on so people could read and open blogs clearer. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I followed all the instructions learning about colours and how they have unique computer language codes. I successfully created a light blue background and black text over that on my webpage</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Initially I was stuck when experimenting with the programming and not knowing how to correct my errors, however I did manage to correct them and finally research the clours i wanted and succesfully put them on my design</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
