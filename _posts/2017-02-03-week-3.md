After attempting to post blogs that id forgotten to write up, my github had 3-4 published blogs that actually worked. </td>

    <td>My github didn't appear with a 404 error on the first two lessons. I didn’t know how to duplicate a google doc with the standard template for these next blogs so am writing it on a new document.

In this lesson I learnt more ways of coding in repl.it since starting last half term. I initially had problems with using my github so gave up and started repl.it. I then used the google classroom to explore ways of making programs and the internet. These didn’t work.
